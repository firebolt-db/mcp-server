# [](#role-management-in-firebolt)Role management in Firebolt

Role management in Firebolt allows you to control access to resources within your data warehouse by assigning specific privileges to users and roles. Firebolt supports two types of roles: [system roles](/Overview/Security/Role-Based%20Access%20Control/role-management/system-roles.html) and [custom roles](/Overview/Security/Role-Based%20Access%20Control/role-management/custom-roles.html).

Privileges can be granted to custom roles either by the [account\_admin](/Overview/organizations-accounts.html#account-administrative-role) or the [resource owner](/Overview/Security/Role-Based%20Access%20Control/ownership.html).
