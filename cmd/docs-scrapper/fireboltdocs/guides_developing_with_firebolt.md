# [](#developing-with-firebolt)Developing with Firebolt

Firebolt provides multiple SDKs, drivers, and libraries to integrate with various programming environments, enabling developers to run queries, manage databases, and build data-driven applications efficiently.

This guide covers how to develop with Firebolt using different languages and frameworks, including:

- [Node.js](/Guides/developing-with-firebolt/connecting-with-nodejs.html) – Use the Firebolt Node.js SDK to interact with Firebolt databases.
- [Python](/Guides/developing-with-firebolt/connecting-with-Python.html) – Leverage the Firebolt Python SDK for data analysis and automation.
- [JDBC](/Guides/developing-with-firebolt/connecting-with-jdbc.html) – Connect Firebolt to Java-based applications with the JDBC driver.
- [SQLAlchemy](/Guides/developing-with-firebolt/connecting-with-sqlalchemy.html) – Integrate Firebolt with SQLAlchemy for ORM-based workflows.
- [.NET SDK](/Guides/developing-with-firebolt/connecting-with-net-sdk.html) – Work with Firebolt databases using .NET applications.
- [Go](/Guides/developing-with-firebolt/connecting-with-go.html) – Access Firebolt from Go applications with the Firebolt Go client.

Each section provides installation instructions, authentication methods, and query examples tailored to the respective language or framework.
