# [](#schema-permissions)Schema permissions

In Firebolt, a **schema** is a logical namespace within a database that organizes **tables**, **views**, and other objects. Schema-level permissions allow roles to perform specific actions, such as accessing, modifying, or managing objects within a schema.

To perform actions on a schema or its objects, the role must also have the **USAGE** privilege on the schemaâ€™s parent database.
