# [](#regexp_extract_all)REGEXP\_EXTRACT\_ALL

Returns an array that contains all matches of a `<pattern>` within the given `<expression>`. If the pattern does not match, returns an empty array. If you want return the first match of `<pattern>` within the `<expression>`, use [REGEXP\_EXTRACT](/sql_reference/functions-reference/string/regexp-extract.html).

```
REGEXP_EXTRACT_ALL(<expression>, <pattern>[,'<flag>[...]',[<index>]])
```

Parameter Description Supported input types `<expression>` The string from which to extract a substring, based on a regular expression. `TEXT` `<pattern>` A [re2 regular expression](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) for matching with the string. `TEXT` `<flag>` Optional. Flag that allows additional controls over the regularâ€™s expression matching behavior. If using multiple flags, you can include them in the same single-quote block without any separator character. Firebolt supports the following RE2 flags to override default matching behavior. With `-` in front, you can disable the flag.  
\* `i` - Specifies case-insensitive matching.  
\* `m` - Specifies multi-line mode. In this mode, `^` and `$` characters in the regex match the beginning and end of the line.  
\* `s` - (Enabled per default) Specifies that the `.` metacharacter in regex matches the newline character in addition to any character in `.`  
\* `U` - Specifies non-greedy mode. In this mode, the meaning of the metacharacters `*` and `+` in regex `<pattern>` are swapped with `*?` and `+?`, respectively. See the examples using flags below for the difference in how results are returned. `<index>` Optional. Indicates which subgroup of each expression match should be returned. The default value is `0` which means the whole match is returned, independent of any number of given subgroups. An `INTEGER` between `0` and `N` where `N` is the number subgroups in the `<pattern>`.

## [](#example)Example

```
SELECT
	REGEXP_EXTRACT_ALL('Hello Year 2023, yeah!', '[A-Za-z]+');
```

**Returns**: `["Hello", "Year", "yeah"]`

Despite using subgroups in the regular expression, each full match will be returned as the optional `<index>` argument is not set (the default value `0` is used instead).

```
SELECT
	REGEXP_EXTRACT_ALL('Learning about #REGEX in #Firebolt 2023', '#([A-Z])[a-z]+', 'i');
```

**Returns**: `["#REGEX", "#Firebolt"]`

The regular expression contains two subgroups which allows us to set the `<index>` argument to something between `0` and `2`. Every other value will cause an exception to be thrown. Setting `<index>` to `0` would cause that all full matches `["#REGEX", "#Firebolt"]` are returned (same behavior as not setting this value, see the example above), while a `2` would return the second subgroup of each match `["EGEX", "irebolt"]`.

```
SELECT
	REGEXP_EXTRACT_ALL('Learning about #REGEX in #Firebolt 2023', '#([A-Z])([a-z]+)', 'i', 1);
```

**Returns**: `["R", "F"]`
